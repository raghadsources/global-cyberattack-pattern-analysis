 Interpretation & Security Context

- Temporal Trend: Dataset spans 2002–2025 with peak reporting in 2021.
  This suggests concentration of disclosure activity and possible coordination around patch cycles.

- Vendor Exposure:Microsoft tops the list with 346 entries,
  reflecting the outsized impact of widely deployed platforms on enterprise risk posture.

- Remediation Timing: Median lead-time (add→due) ≈ 21 days,
  indicating typical remediation windows of ~1–2 months; adjust SLAs for critical CVEs accordingly.

- Operational Note: Validate negative/very short lead-times; they often arise from retroactive
  updates or pre-assigned CVEs, which can skew SLA analytics if not handled explicitly.
